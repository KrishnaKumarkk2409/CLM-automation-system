        @sarah.legal: Hey team, quick update on contracts
        - TechCorp renewal looking good
        - They want 2-year term this time
        - Pricing increase reasonable at 5%
        
        @mike.procurement: Sounds good. What about DataSystems?
        Their SLA has been solid, no issues
        
        @lisa.finance: Budget wise we're okay with both renewals
        CloudVentures is the one I'm worried about - they've had billing errors
        
        @tom.it: From technical side:
        - TechCorp modules work great, approve new ones
        - DataSystems uptime has been 99.8% - excellent  
        - CloudVentures had that outage last month...
        
        @sarah.legal: Speaking of CloudVentures, found discrepancy in their contact info
        Some docs have different email/address than others
        Need to verify which is current
        
        @mike.procurement: I'll reach out to them directly
        Their main contact is usually responsive
        
        @lisa.finance: FYI - CloudVentures contract expires in 2 months
        If we're renewing need to start talks soon
        
        @sarah.legal: Good catch! Adding to urgent list
        Will send renewal notice this week
        
        @tom.it: Also heads up - InnovateLabs asked about early renewal
        They're happy with current NDA terms
        
        @mike.procurement: That's great, one less thing to negotiate
        Simple renewal should be quick
        
        @sarah.legal: Agreed. Summary of priorities:
        1. CloudVentures renewal (urgent - expires soon)
        2. TechCorp 2-year renewal (in progress)  
        3. DataSystems renewal (routine)
        4. InnovateLabs NDA renewal (simple)
        
        All: Sounds like a plan! üëç
