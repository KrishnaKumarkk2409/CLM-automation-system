        CONCERNS RAISED:
        1. CloudVentures has different contact info in various documents
           - SLA shows: partnerships@cloudventures.com
           - NDA shows: legal@cloudventures.com  
           - Need to clarify correct contact
        
        2. Multiple contract versions for same parties causing confusion
           - TechCorp has original + amendment + renewal draft
           - Version control system needed
        
        3. Expiring contracts need attention:
           - CloudVentures service contract expires soon (Oct 2024)
           - Need renewal discussion ASAP
